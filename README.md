Loom Recording Link: [Insert Link]
# Example 1: [https://www.loom.com/share/06b3f9f238a34aa88019ecf8e830b79d?sid=156d4916-c8f7-4f41-b7c1-e4c72a8953c4].
# In the above video link, I present two examples. I will start by explaining example one, which is a JavaScript code and it is imperative.

# Example 2: [https://www.loom.com/share/a7da9e1520034cd78d7d6e534e5b1cbc?sid=e4957410-b469-48bb-a21d-d3c9cbd36d31]
# In the above video, I explain the concept of declarative programming and its benefits. I discuss how declarative programming focuses on describing what should be achieved without specifying how to achieve it, emphasizing immutability and higher-level abstractions. I use an example of a cooking process defined as an array of steps to illustrate how declarative programming can be applied. No action is requested from the viewers.
